# Rspack Resolver

> [!NOTE]  
>  This is a fork of [oxc-resolver](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc-resolver), and will be used in Rspack cause 100% compatible with enhanced-resolve is the non-goal of oxc-resolver itself, we may add enhanced-resolve specific features like [`pnp support`](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/issues/2236) and [`alternative support`](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/issues/5052) in the future.

Rust port of [enhanced-resolve].

* built-in [tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin]
  * support extending tsconfig defined in `tsconfig.extends`
  * support paths alias defined in `tsconfig.compilerOptions.paths`
  * support project references defined `tsconfig.references`
  * support [template variable ${configDir} for substitution of config files directory path](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58042)
* supports in-memory file system via the `FileSystem` trait
* contains `tracing` instrumentation

## Usage

The following usages apply to both Rust and Node.js; the code snippets are written in JavaScript.

To handle the `exports` field in `package.json`, ESM and CJS need to be differentiated.

### ESM

Per [ESM Resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm)

> defaultConditions is the conditional environment name array, ["node", "import"].

This means when the caller is an ESM import (`import "module"`), resolve options should be

```javascript
{
  "conditionNames": ["node", "import"]
}
```

### CJS

Per [CJS Resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together)

> LOAD_PACKAGE_EXPORTS(X, DIR)
>
> 5. let MATCH = PACKAGE_EXPORTS_RESOLVE(pathToFileURL(DIR/NAME), "." + SUBPATH,
>   `package.json` "exports", ["node", "require"]) defined in the ESM resolver.

This means when the caller is a CJS require (`require("module")`), resolve options should be

```javascript
{
  "conditionNames": ["node", "require"]
}
```

### Cache

To support both CJS and ESM with the same cache:

```javascript
const esmResolver = ResolverFactory({
  conditionNames: ["node", "import"]
});

const cjsResolver = esmResolver.cloneWithOptions({
  conditionNames: ["node", "require"]
});
```

### Browser Field

From this [non-standard spec](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec):

> The `browser` field is provided to JavaScript bundlers or component tools when packaging modules for client side use.

The option is

```javascript
{
  "aliasFields": ["browser"]
}
```

### Main Field

```javascript
{
  "mainFields": ["module", "main"]
}
```

Quoting esbuild's documentation:

* `main` - This is [the standard field](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#main) for all packages that are meant to be used with node. The name main is hard-coded in to node's module resolution logic itself. Because it's intended for use with node, it's reasonable to expect that the file path in this field is a CommonJS-style module.
* `module` - This field came from a [proposal](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/f31319be735b21739756b87d551f6711bd7aa283/proposal.md) for how to integrate ECMAScript modules into node. Because of this, it's reasonable to expect that the file path in this field is an ECMAScript-style module. This proposal wasn't adopted by node (node uses "type": "module" instead) but it was adopted by major bundlers because ECMAScript-style modules lead to better tree shaking, or dead code removal.
* `browser` - This field came from a [proposal](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901/49493836fb873ddaa4b8a7aa0ef2352119f69211) that allows bundlers to replace node-specific files or modules with their browser-friendly versions. It lets you specify an alternate browser-specific entry point. Note that it is possible for a package to use both the browser and module field together (see the note below).

### Errors

* `Error: Package subpath '.' is not defined by "exports" in` - occurs when resolving without `conditionNames`.
